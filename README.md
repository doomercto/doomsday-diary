# The Doomsday Diary

The Doomsday Diary is DOOMER's submission for the Onchain Summer Buildathon. We are competing in the Social track, aiming to create a viral onchain social experience that inspires community engagement all summer long and beyond.

## What is The Doomsday Diary?

The Doomsday Diary is an online forum where users share their doom storiesâ€”moments when everything seemed to go wrong. Whether it's a crypto misadventure or a life's pitfall, these entries allow authors to recount their experiences, share lessons learned, and connect with others who have faced similar challenges. Through this project and platform, we hope to build camaraderie, empathy, and trust within our community.

## Why Are We Doing This?

The Doomsday Diary aligns perfectly with the $DOOMER ethos of learning from adversity and growing through shared experiences. This platform helps users connect over shared challenges and learn from each other's mistakes and successes, strengthening our community.

## How Does It Work?

- Posting Stories: Users can post their doom stories anonymously or under their Coinbase username.
- Reactions: Readers can engage with posts using one of the five available reactions.
- Secure Login: To post or react, users need to log in through the Coinbase login flow. This ensures secure and verified interactions while keeping Coinbase funds unconnected. Users can choose to remain anonymous or display their username when posting.
- Optional Wallet Display: Posters can include their Ethereum wallet address, allowing readers to view the wallet's BaseScan page or send donations if they wish.

Join us in sharing, learning, and building a stronger community through The Doomsday Diary. By sharing our doom stories, we build a resilient community that embraces the harsh realities of life and crypto. J Together, we can turn our moments of doom into opportunities for growth and connection. Join us in turning gloom into gold.
