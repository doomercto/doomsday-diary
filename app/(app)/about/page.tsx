        What is The Doomsday Diary?
      </h2>
      <p>
        The Doomsday Diary is an online forum where users share their doom
        storiesâ€”moments when everything seemed to go wrong. Whether it&apos;s a
        crypto misadventure or a life&apos;s pitfall, these entries allow
        authors to recount their experiences, share lessons learned, and connect
        with others who have faced similar challenges. Through this project and
        platform, we hope to build camaraderie, empathy, and trust within our
        community.

        from adversity and growing through shared experiences. This platform
        helps users connect over shared challenges and learn from each

        How Does It Work?
      </h2>
      <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
        <li>
          Posting Stories: Users can post their doom stories anonymously or
          under their Coinbase username.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reactions: Readers can engage with posts using one of the five
          available reactions.
        </li>
        <li>
          Secure Login: To post or react, users need to log in through the
          Coinbase login flow. This ensures secure and verified interactions
          while keeping Coinbase funds unconnected. Users can choose to remain
          anonymous or display their username when posting.
        </li>
        <li>
          Optional Wallet Display: Posters can include their Ethereum wallet
          address, allowing readers to view the wallet&apos;s BaseScan page or
          send donations if they wish.
